# Tribo-Model
Matlab code for modeling the electrochemical current from the tribological contact between an AFM tip and a polarized stainless steel oxide in a corrosive electrolyte.

## Introduction
* Tribo-Model is a repository for a set of Matlab functons that model the tribocorrosion current arising from the interaction of a non-conductive diamond AFM tip and the stainless steel oxide exposed to a 0.6 M NaCl solution and polarized to a set potential.    
* It expects that data files will be included and plotted along with the simulation results
* This is a model that is very much under development! 

## Background
This project started as a way to interpret experimental data obtained from an AFM with the tip acting as a single asperity contact on a polarized stainless steel sample exposed to a corrosive electrolyte.

## Code
This project was written using Matlab R2020a. 

## Installation
The files should be downloaded into the same folder with the experimental data files.
